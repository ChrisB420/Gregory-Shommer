            <h2>Our Calling</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Wings of the Cherubim</strong> is more than a name—it's a divine assignment, a prophetic platform established under the leading of the Holy Spirit to unveil sacred truths in these final days. We are messengers of the flame, custodians of the scrolls, and servants of the Light that shines from the Throne of God.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mission is clear: awaken the 42,000 chosen ones, ignite a holy hunger for truth, and restore the fear of the Lord through biblically grounded seminars, digital revelation, and creative outreach.

            <h2>The Scroll System</h2>
            <p>
                The heart of this ministry flows through the Scroll System—divinely revealed teachings presented in digital scrolls. Each scroll carries a sacred blueprint: the voice of prophecy, Scripture, illustrations, and Spirit-led instruction for spiritual growth and national awakening.
            </p>
            <p>
                These scrolls are not mere lessons—they are instruments of alignment, tools of activation, and keys to a deeper understanding of God's eternal plan.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Leadership</h2>
            <p>
                This mission was initiated through the prophetic mentorship of <strong>Gregory</strong>, a chosen vessel carrying insight into God's nature, the Seven Spirits of God, and the redemptive power of Christ. Working closely with <strong>Chris Beda Oticha</strong>, the steward of digital expression, Wings of the Cherubim is both heavenly and earthly—a place where revelation meets design, where prophetic fire touches the internet.
